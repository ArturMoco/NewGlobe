# Testing & Monitoring Strategy – Feature Toggle API
*(with GPT-assisted agents and .NET code examples)*

---

## 1. Context & Goal

The **Feature Toggle API** is used by almost all services and applications within the organization, acting as a **single point of failure**.  
Any downtime or incompatible change can impact critical production services.

This strategy ensures:

- **Safety and predictability** in releases.  
- **Prevention of regressions** and breaking changes for consumers.  
- **Agility** through GPT-assisted specialized agents.  
- **Clear communication** with the entire development team, even for those who are not QA specialists.

## 2. Testing Pyramid + GPT Agents

The strategy follows the testing pyramid, enhanced by **GPT agents**, each with a specific role to speed up tasks and keep results consistent.

| Test Layer         | Objective                                | Tools                             | Stage / Trigger                           | GPT Agent (Role)                                                              | Agent Output                       | Best Practices / Sources                 | Approval Criteria                        |

## 3. Code Examples

**Unit – Type/value validation**
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Feature_DefaultValue_ShouldMatchType()
{
    var feature = new Feature { Key = "ftone", Type = "Boolean", DefaultValue = false };
    Assert.IsType<bool>(feature.DefaultValue);
}
```

**Integration – Authenticated API call**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Get_Project_Should_Return_Success()
{
    using var app = new TestApiFactory();
    var client = app.CreateClient();
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);
    var res = await client.GetAsync("/projects/c44f0476-090a-11ee-be56-0242ac120002");
    res.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

**Contract – Pact validation**
```csharp
[Fact]
public void Provider_Should_Match_Consumer_Contract()
{
    var pactVerifier = new PactVerifier("FeatureToggleAPI", "ConsumerService");
    pactVerifier.ServiceProvider("FeatureToggleAPI", new Uri("https://api.test"))
                .HonoursPactWith("ConsumerService")
                .PactUri("consumer-pact.json")
                .Verify();
}
```

**E2E – Critical flow with Playwright .NET**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Login_And_Update_Feature()
{
    using var pw = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
    var browser = await pw.Chromium.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions { Headless = false });
    var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(new BrowserNewContextOptions { StorageStatePath = "auth.json" });
    var page = await context.NewPageAsync();
    await page.GotoAsync("https://app.test/projects");
    await page.Locator("text=Test Master").ClickAsync();
    await page.Locator("text=API TEST").CheckAsync();
}
```

## 4. Compatibility & Risk Reduction

- **API versioning** (`/v1`, `/v2`) to avoid breaking existing consumers.  
- **Automated contract validation** with OpenAPI Diff + Pact.  
- **Canary releases** to monitor production impact before 100% rollout.  
- **Post-deploy smoke tests** to validate critical endpoints.

---

## 5. State Initialization

- **Idempotent seeds** for consistent test data in staging.  
- **Execution isolation** via `X-Test-Run` headers and suffixed names.  
- **Safe cleanup** only for test-created data.

---

## 6. Post-Deploy & Continuous Monitoring

- Healthchecks every 5 minutes on `/projects` and `/features/status`.  
- Alerts for:
  - P95 latency > 500ms.
  - HTTP 4xx/5xx.
  - Contract breakage (missing required fields).
- **Runbooks** for quick investigation and canary rollback if needed.

---

## 7. What to Avoid

- **Excessive E2E** – keep only critical flows.  
- **Destructive tests** in production.  
- **Sensitive data** in non-production environments.  
- **Over-mocking** that hides real integration issues.

---

## 8. Pipeline Flow with GPT Agents

1. **Pull Request** → Contract Guardian (validate OpenAPI changes, suggest Pact tests).  
2. **CI Build** → Test Generator (stubs for Unit/Integration).  
3. **Staging** → Seed Planner (generate test data for E2E).  
4. **Post-Tests** → Report Analyst (Performance + Security).  
5. **Production** → Monitoring Analyst (interpret alerts, suggest actions).

---

## Executive Summary

This solution combines **QA best practices** with **GPT-assisted automation** to:

- **Accelerate test creation** and maintain standardization.  
- **Reduce risk** of regressions and production incidents.  
- **Increase visibility** of quality status for the entire team.

**Me**, as the **QA Lead**, remain the final decision-maker, ensuring automation **enhances but never replaces** human judgment.
