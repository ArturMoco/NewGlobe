# Testing & Monitoring Strategy – Feature Toggle API  

*Aligned with the requirements from the “Overview” section of the pre-work and the broader Product Integration Framework, this strategy goes beyond simply turning requirements into test scripts. It addresses real-world ambiguity by defining robust processes that ensure delivery even when specifications are incomplete, and it integrates preventive and reactive measures to safeguard the Feature Toggle API — a critical single point of failure in the NewGlobe ecosystem.*

---

## 1. Context & Goal

The **Feature Toggle API** is used by almost all services and applications within the organization, making it a **single point of failure**.  
Any downtime or incompatible change can impact critical production services and downstream systems.

**Core objectives of this strategy:**

- **Safety and predictability** in releases.  
- **Prevention of regressions** and breaking changes for consumers.  
- **Agility and consistency** through GPT-assisted specialized agents.  
- **Full traceability and transparency** for both QA and non-QA stakeholders.  
- **Scalability** so that the approach can be applied to other APIs or products.

## 2. Sequencing & Prioritization

Following the **Testing Pyramid**, the order of execution is:

1. **Unit Tests** – validate core logic in isolation.  
2. **Integration Tests** – validate endpoints, authentication, and persistence.  
3. **Contract Tests (CDC)** – detect breaking changes early, before merge.  
4. **E2E Critical Flows** – validate the most business-critical scenarios.  
5. **Performance Tests** – ensure latency/throughput meet SLAs.  
6. **Security Tests** – validate against OWASP Top 10.  
7. **Smoke Tests in Production** – quick validation post-deploy.  
8. **Continuous Monitoring** – detect and act on live incidents.

Tests are prioritized by **risk and impact**:

- **High Priority:** Business-critical paths, high-change areas, past defect patterns.  
- **Medium Priority:** Secondary flows with moderate usage.  
- **Low Priority:** Rarely used or low-impact features.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Contract Layer – CDC with `oasdiff` + GPT
```json
{
  "breakingChanges": [
    {
      "path": "/v1/features/{key}",
      "method": "get",
      "change": "type-changed",
      "from": "value:boolean",
      "to": "value:object(status:boolean,source:string)",
      "impact": "High"
    }
  ]
}
```
**GPT Agent Output:**  
- Risk: High – affects all consumers expecting `boolean`.  
- Remediation: Keep `/v1` for boolean, create `/v2` for object `{status, source}`.  
- Suggested Tests: Pact contract for both versions.

## 5. Environment & State Management

- **Environments:**  
  - `DEV` → Developer testing & early feedback.  
  - `TEST` → Full integration, automated suites.  
  - `STAGING` → Production-like, E2E + performance + security.  
  - `PROD` → Canary deploy + smoke tests + monitoring.

- **State Initialization:**  
  - **Idempotent seeds** for consistent test data.  
  - **Execution isolation** via `X-Test-Run` headers.  
  - **Safe cleanup** only for test-created data.

---

## 6. Post-Deploy & Continuous Monitoring

- Healthchecks every 5 minutes on `/projects` and `/features/status`.  
- Alerts for:
  - P95 latency > 500ms.
  - HTTP 4xx/5xx error spikes.
  - Contract breakage (missing required fields).
- **Runbooks** for immediate mitigation, including canary rollback.

---

## 7. What to Avoid

- **Over-testing with E2E** — only cover critical flows.  
- **Destructive tests in production**.  
- **Sensitive data** in non-prod environments.  
- **Over-mocking** — avoid hiding real integration issues.

---

## 8. Integration with Product Framework

This strategy aligns with the **Product Integration Framework**:

- **Step 1:** Assess product architecture, stack, and current testing maturity.  
- **Step 2:** Map risks and critical flows.  
- **Step 3:** Adapt the pyramid and agent roles to the product’s reality.  
- **Step 4:** Integrate into CI/CD with monitoring gates.  
- **Step 5:** Continuous review and improvement.

---

## Executive Summary

This solution combines **QA best practices** with **GPT-assisted automation** to:

- **Accelerate test creation** and maintain standardization.  
- **Reduce risk** of regressions and production incidents.  
- **Increase visibility** of quality status for the entire team.  
- **Scale** to other products with minimal adaptation.

As QA Lead, I remain the final decision-maker, ensuring automation **supports but never replaces** human judgment.
